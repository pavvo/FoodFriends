# FoodFriends
Fun Food Friends, a web application for planning your next potluck, which hopefully feels like something rather "real world", in that you can imagine using these technologies in your own production projects. The big idea in this app is that you and your friends will be able to log in and be able to see and post information about what you're planning to bring to the potlock.
